Its conservation status is currently <strong>Least Concern</strong>.<br /> There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across its wide range, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017 of 110,000.<br>The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the bruin, from Middle English.
